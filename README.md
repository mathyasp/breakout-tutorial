# Breakout Tutorial
## ACS - 1320

This assignment creates a replica of the game `Breakout` using JavaScript

This project was intended to demonstrate certain concepts in JavaScrip
- Starting with a basic `.js` file to practice basic JS functionality
- The next step was to practice using a linter with `ES-Lint`
- Next was to incorporate Object Oriented Programming concepts by using:
  - Classes
  - Inheritance
- After that, practice working with bundling using `Webpack`
- Finally, the code was converted to TypeScript to practice using explicit types.

## To Run:
- Clone/download this repo
- Navigate to the current branch (for now) by entering `git checkout bundling` in the terminal
- Run `npm install` to install the dependencies
- Run `npm run build` to launch Webpack in production mode
- Open using live server
- Play the game!

## (alternatively):
- click the link in the `About` section on the right

## Tools/Technologies used:
- HTML
- JavaScript
